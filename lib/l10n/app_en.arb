Therefore, a collective investment is the most realistic way to acquire solar energy solution.  The profitability of solar modules are tied both to the value generated by the modules as well as whatever equipment it replaces. In order to maximize the profitability of solar technology, the product should be installed as a part of a building's regular maintenance schedule. If the solar panels live for up to 40 years, this means that in Møllenberg, multiple owners of the same building/apartment, could use the same panels.  Energy saving will differ for one investment to another. This is a result of different variables such as location, radiation, weather, lifetime, size, product, energy prices, inflation and more.",

  "energy_storage_content_battery_p2": "Among the energy storage systems the battery has received a lot of attention worldwide, especially the lithium-ion batteries as they offer high energy density, low maintenance and can be recharged hundreds of times. The working principle of the Lithium-Ion batteries is the transmission of Li+ ions from the positive electrode to the negative one creating an electric current. The low cost and versatility make the Li-ion batteries the first choice to power portable electronic devices such as mobile phones and are also used in battery energy storage systems (BESS) to keep the surplus of energy generation from solar and wind. The shelf life of the batteries is predicted to be between 3 and 6 years, as the rate at which they deteriorate is 2-5% per month the Li-ion batteries have to be replaced more frequently than other energy storage systems.

PHS provides efficiency of 85% and represents 97% of the European Union’s current energy storage facilities. Although being one of the cheapest with regard to cost per kilowatt-hour, 1000-1900 NOK/kWh, it has the highest construction cost.

Norway already counts 10 pumped storage plants(PSP), one of them near Trondheim named Brattingfoss. This PSP cost 30 million euros to build and it’s the first power plant in Norway set in operation in 1955. Pumped hydro technology is expensive to put in place, large amounts of money have to be invested in their construction. As there’s an already existing pumped hydro facility no initial expense would be needed. This could be an interesting option to store the solar energy long term and from PV panels",
  "energy_storage_content_thermal_p1": "Thermal Energy Storage(TES) is a method that keeps energy by heating or cooling a storage medium. Most TES technologies can be readjusted to fit in solar applications. Each thermal storage approach has specific requirements regarding the temperature level, storage duration, structural system, cost and storage material properties among others. It is usually formed by one or more tanks containing the storage medium such as molten salts, packed bed or pressurised water.

  "solar_technology_cell_types_p1": " Monocrystalline cells can be identified by their wafer shape and black or grey colouring. With 16 to 24%, they achieve the highest efficiency. However, due to their complex manufacturing process, they are also the most expensive.",
  "solar_technology_cell_types_p2": "Polycrystalline cells are not made from a homogeneous ingot, and they are cheaper than monocrystalline ones. However, the less perfect crystal structure lowers the efficiency of polycrystalline modules to about 14 to 18%. They can be recognised by the shiny blue colour of the Wafers.",
  "solar_technology_cell_types_p3": "Thin-film cells can be made from photoactive semiconductor materials like amorphous-based silicon (a-Si), cadmium telluride (CdTe), or copper indium diselenide (CIS). A very thin layer of those materials is applied to a low-cost substrate (f. ex. glass, metal, or plastic). Thin-film cells can be bend and in comparison, to monocrystalline and polycrystalline cells they are not cut into wafers. This gives more possibilities in shape and dimension and allows creative usage in architecture. Moreover, the cells efficiency is less dependent on the surroundings temperature. The downsides of thin-film cells are a toxic manufacturing process and a lower efficiency. The efficiency varies between 4 to 10 %.",
  "solar_technology_colored_header": "Coloured PV",
  "solar_technology_colored_p1": "One way to integrate PV modules into the building envelope in a visually appealing way is to use coloured modules. The main areas of application are façades and roofs, where the modules can either be inserted as inconspicuously as possible into the existing structures or deliberately used as an architectural design element. In this way, they offer the opportunity to increase the acceptance of PV in heritage areas such as Møllenberg. ",
  "solar_technology_colored_p2": "To add colour to a black PV module, part of the incident light must be reflected by the module. This means that fewer photons are available to generate electricity, which lowers the efficiency of the panels. There are different ways to colour PV modules. One of the most common techniques is the use of single and multilayer films that reflect certain wavelengths of visible light due to interference and thereby create a colour. Other possibilities are to print pigments on the cover glass or to influence the scattering and absorption. ",
  "solar_technology_colored_p3": "To compare the efficiency of different colour shades, they must have the same luminosity. The reason for this is that brighter colours lead to a higher reflectance, which increases the relative loss of the modules. Researchers have found that yellow-green colours can achieve the highest efficiencies. This is because the human eye is particularly sensitive to the corresponding wavelengths and thus fewer photons need to be reflected for colouring. Nevertheless, a theoretical efficiency of more than 29% is possible for all sRGB colours if they have a relatively low luminosity.",
  "solar_technology_intro": "Photovoltaic (PV) cells are devices that can convert solar radiation into direct current. The performance of PV modules depends on several factors. These include the size, material, and electrical efficiency of the solar cells. In addition, climatic conditions also play an important role, as cloudiness and high temperatures lead to a reduction in the power output.",
  "solar_technology_tiles_header": "Solar Roof Tiles",
  "solar_technology_tiles_p1": "Solar roof tiles can be used as a substitute for normal roof tiles and are therefore particularly suitable for new roof construction or roof renovation. There are solar roof tiles with different shapes, colours, and PV technologies. Mono- or polycrystalline cells can be incorporated into the tile, as well as thin film technologies can be applied to the tiles. The usual efficiencies are in the range of 10 to 15%.",
  "solar_technology_transparent_header": "Transparent PV",
  "solar_technology_transparent_p1": "In recent years, research has been conducted into the development of transparent solar cells. These offer the possibility to use glass surfaces for electricity generation. Especially for buildings with large glass facades, the solar cells can enable the buildings to generate more than 40% of their energy consumption themselves. However, the transparency is currently still associated with losses in efficiency, which is why they cannot yet compete with conventional silicon modules. The difficulty in manufacturing transparent solar cells is to enable the transmission of visible light while absorbing photons in the range of non-visible wavelengths. Most technologies for the production of transparent solar cells are based on thin film PV. For this purpose, a layer of a semiconductor less than 20 nm thick is deposited on glass. This reduces the transparency of the glass by at least 20%. Efficiencies range from 1% to 10% depending on transparency and manufacturing process.",

  "solarpot_pot_bispehaugen": "Bispehaugen is an elementary school surrounded by open space. Because of this the building receives a fair amount of sunlight both on the walls 10-12 hours and the roof 14-20 hours.

  "solarpot_pot_p1": "Results of the simulation shows that the exposure on Møllenberg varies from 20 hours at most during summer to 4 hours during the winter. Sun hours distribution is even throughout the district, with a couple of outliers, towards the southern part of the district.",

  "solarpot_rad_p1": "Photovoltaic (PV) systems convert irradiance into useable electricity. Irradiance is a term used to describe the strength of the electromagnetic radiation a surface receives. The primary factor determining the irradiance strength is the radiations angle of impact with a surface. If a ray hits a surface with an incident angle of 90 degrees, the  impact yields the maximum amount of energy. Likewise, if the incident angle is very sharp the sunray will reflect of the surface, and therefore yield less energy (CE, u.d.).",
