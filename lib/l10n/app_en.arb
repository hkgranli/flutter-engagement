  "about_project_blockp1": "This application is developed as a part of a master thesis at NTNU. The aim of the thesis is to research the effects of digital technology in a citizen engagement process. Citizen engagement is a democratic process where governments or project owners share information related to a project or technologies, with the aim of educating the public and gather feedback with the citizen's unique perspective. This project uses information produced by Helios on solar technology and aims for citizens of Møllenberg.",
  "about_project_blockp2": "Helios is a project ran by NTNU's Faculty of Engineering. The aim of the project is enhancing optimal exploitation of solar energy in Nordic cities through the digitalization of the built environment. The historic area of Møllenberg is a special focus of research. This is because the heritage buildings introduces unique challenges related to sustainable conservation and development of historical areas.",
  "about_project_blockp3": "Historic buildings represent a masterpiece of human creativity and hold a significant value in giving people a sense of identity and continuity. The Møllenberg district mainly consists of two-story wooden houses from the 1880s and 1890s. Due to their cultural heritage, it is difficult to get permission for renovating the houses at Møllenberg - even though it is much needed.",

  "economic_sustainability": "Møllenberg is one of the most popular districts in Møllenberg for living. It consists of young people, students and a lower but significant elderly population. The demand after the location and the identity of the area, has caused housing prices to become one of the highest in Trondheim. The prices have caused speculations, which drives the prices further up. Most of the self-owners are therefore people with high income, economic support from family or investors. Large and small investors are the largest owners of property in Møllenberg. As the locations qualities attract students the rental prices are high, which makes good profit. With increasing house prices and stable rent, the risk of the long-term investment is low. Increased geopolitical uncertainty and tension will lead to increased energy cost. Increased living cost will not only come from energy but also other aspects such as food, gas, and materials. This means that the average Norwegian citizen will have a reduced purchasing power in the future. My calculations have shown a low energy price today results in a non-profitable investment. If energy prices in Trondheim increases to the same level as Oslo, the result would be quite different. Then energy prices would pass the margin of either 0,5kWh or 0,8kWh, and solar panels would give economic returns. This is also to be expected. Higher prices tend to hit low-income communities harder than those with higher income. Seventy percent of the people living in Møllenberg are to be considered as low-income residents (Eiendomsprofil AS, 2022). This creates an issue where energy solutions are viable and accessible, but not affordable.",

  "energy_storage_content_battery_p1": "Lithium-ion batteries come with some safety risks, fire and explosion being the most problematic cases. These issues are mainly related to a deterioration of the components forming the battery and the possible unwanted electrochemical reactions. However, it can also be due to the environment conditions like high temperatures or humidity and to human errors such as poor maintenance of the batteries, water immersion or dropping it causing an impact.",
  "energy_storage_content_battery_p2": "Among the energy storage systems the battery has received a lot of attention worldwide, especially the lithium-ion batteries as they offer high energy density, low maintenance and can be recharged hundreds of times. The working principle of the Lithium-Ion batteries is the transmission of Li+ ions from the positive electrode to the negative one creating an electric current. The low cost and versatility make the Li-ion batteries the first choice to power portable electronic devices such as mobile phones and are also used in battery energy storage systems (BESS) to keep the surplus of energy generation from solar and wind. The shelf life of the batteries is predicted to be between 3 and 6 years, as the rate at which they deteriorate is 2-5% per month the Li-ion batteries have to be replaced more frequently than other energy storage systems. To install them as a storage unit costs from 70 000 and 300 000 NOK.",
  "energy_storage_content_battery_p3": "Installing battery banks in Møllenberg, mainly made of wood, is increasing the possibilities of damaging the buildings, endangering the cultural heritage. It is therefore not a suitable option for this specific neighbourhood.",

  "energy_storage_content_mechanical_p1": "Pumped Hydro Storage (PHS) is a large-scale system that transports water from a lower reservoir to an upper one with the energy received and generates power again when needed letting the water move down again. PHS provides efficiency of 85% and represents 97% of the European Union’s current energy storage facilities. Although being one of the cheapest with regard to cost per kilowatt-hour, 1000-1900 NOK/kWh, it has the highest construction cost. A hydroelectric system isn't difficult to operate and maintain, it has longevity and it's often more cost-effective than other forms of storage.",
  "energy_storage_content_mechanical_p2": "Norway being surrounded by large bodies of water has its energy demand provided by hydropower, the landscape is very favorable for this type of infrastructure. Norway already counts 10 pumped storage plants(PSP), one of them near Trondheim named Brattingfoss. This PSP cost 30 million euros to build and it’s the first power plant in Norway set in operation in 1955. Pumped hydro technology is expensive to put in place, large amounts of money have to be invested in their construction. As there’s an already existing pumped hydro facility no initial expense would be needed. This could be an interesting option to store the solar energy long term and from PV panels",
  "energy_storage_content_thermal_p1": "Thermal Energy Storage(TES) is a method that keeps energy by heating or cooling a storage medium. Most TES technologies can be readjusted to fit in solar applications. Each thermal storage approach has specific requirements regarding the temperature level, storage duration, structural system, cost and storage material properties among others. It is usually formed by one or more tanks containing the storage medium such as molten salts, packed bed or pressurised water. The cost of TES varies in function of the number of tanks, the medium and the space occupied, it ranges from 200 to 500 NOK/kWh.",

This also excludes a high portion of the population from the economic growth in the real estate market. This issue is not unique for Norway but is a central issue in many part of the world. The effect of this could be increased dividing of class and wealth. Møllenberg is one of the most active and vibrant communities in Trondheim. With low ownership of cars and short distance to attractions there is a lot of activity in the streets. Local businesses are to be found along the streets and deliver services like cafes, hairdressers, tattoo shops, street food and more. Møllenberg is known for its large number of students, but there are also families, elderly, and other residents in the area. Students live together in dorms and rental apartments. This gives a unique possibility for sharing of knowledge, culture, language and more. At the same time, unfortunately, the culture of Møllenberg has slowly moved from the “engaged students” to a party district, according to some articles and reader posts in Adresseavisa newspaper last autumn (Hansen, Bjørn Erik 2021). Other residents than students are now pressing the police and municipality to act against this, but no such action has been done yet.",
