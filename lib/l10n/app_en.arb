  "about_project_blockp1": "Project purpose is to research the effectiveness of ICT and interactive education such as augmented reality (AR) to engage citizens in local urban planning projects. This is known as citizen engagement: a process in which knowledge is shared by project owners with the citizens and where the citizens respond with their concerns and feedback both positive and negative. This project uses the knowledge created by the Helios project on Photovoltaic (PV) technology in the historic Møllenberg area.",
  "about_project_blockp2": "Helios is a project ran by the faculty of engineering at NTNU with the aim of enhancing optimal exploitation of solar systems in the Nordic built environment. One of the focus areas of Helios has been Møllenberg, and there has been done extensive research related to economy, ",
  "about_project_blockp3": "Historic buildings represent a masterpiece of human creativity and hold a significant value in giving people a sense of identity and continuity. The Møllenberg district mainly consists of two-story wooden houses from the 1880s and 1890s. Due to their cultural heritage, it is difficult to get permission for renovating the houses at Møllenberg - even though it is much needed.",
