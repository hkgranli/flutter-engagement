  "about_project_blockp1": "This application is developed as a part of a master thesis at NTNU. The aim of the thesis is to research the effects of digital technology in a citizen engagement process. Citizen engagement is a democratic process where governments or project owners share information related to a project or technologies, with the aim of educating the public and gather feedback with the citizen's unique perspective. This project uses information produced by Helios on solar technology and aims for citizens of Møllenberg.",
  "about_project_blockp2": "Helios is a project ran by NTNU's Faculty of Engineering. The aim of the project is enhancing optimal exploitation of solar energy in Nordic cities through the digitalization of the built environment. The historic area of Møllenberg is a special focus of research. This is because the heritage buildings introduces unique challenges related to sustainable conservation and development of historical areas.",
  "about_project_blockp3": "Historic buildings represent a masterpiece of human creativity and hold a significant value in giving people a sense of identity and continuity. The Møllenberg district mainly consists of two-story wooden houses from the 1880s and 1890s. Due to their cultural heritage, it is difficult to get permission for renovating the houses at Møllenberg - even though it is much needed.",

  "owner_4p": "In the PPPP-model (People-Private-Public-Partnership) of financing, private individuals, the public sector and companies jointly raise the necessary amount of money. The funds are used to purchase a certain number of PV systems, of which some percentages are owned by private individuals and the remainder by companies. The income from the various PV systems will be divided proportionally among the shareholders, depending on the percentage they have contributed to the crowdfunding. With this joint ownership the responsibility of maintenance is also shared. The owners will receive consistent proportional payments from the profits of the generated power.",
  "owner_community": "In this financing form, private individuals and the public sector jointly raise a certain amount of money. This money is used to purchase a certain amount of PV systems, which are 100% owned by the private individuals. The income from the various PV systems will be divided proportionally among the people, depending on the percentage they have contributed to the crowdfunding. ​",
  "owner_leasing": "Within the leasing model, consumers agree on a service contract with a service provider. This company provides all the technology, including installation. They are also responsible for the entire operation. However, the company owns all the equipment. Customers pay a constant monthly amount to the company. The entire financial risk and operational risk lies with the service provider.​",
  "ownership_context": "A major barrier preventing the extensive installation of solar panels in the Møllenberg area is funding. The financial load may be distributed on several shoulders. In the following models, various solutions are explained more closely. The public and private sectors should not be addressed via a case-by-case approach, but should be addressed directly via a top-down approach across the entire site. The possible funding approaches for this are now presented. ",
